            At Kiras we have many choices of tea. <br>
            Many of which are currently out of stock, <br>
            so when ordering make sure to ask your <br>
            barista what flavours we currently have.<br>
            Most likely it's just earl gray. <br> <br>

            3.50-5.50$

            Do to many requests, and not just a plot <br>
            to over through a mainstream company <br> 
            that rhymes with "Bar Ducks." We are now <br>
            selling sweet creamy frappuccinos. <br>  <br>

            Do to an error made when our founder <br>
            was ordering fruit for other dishes <br>
            we have recently aquired many kinds of <br>
            of fruit. Perfect for smothies, some <br>
            of which being rasp, starw, blue, and <br>
            all sorts of berries.  <br>  <br> 

            3.00-4.50  <br>  <br> please buy a smothie we need to get rid of all this fruit.
